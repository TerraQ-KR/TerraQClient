# TerraQ

A new Flutter project.

## **1. Project Introduction**
TerraQ is application to keep people to have eco-friendly habits by individuals with small, actionable missions tailored to combat climate challenges.  
#
## **2. Problem definition**
The challenge we are addressing with our project, **TerraQ**, is the absence of a platform that effectively promotes sustainable consumption and production for both individuals and businesses. This lack of a dedicated platform has led to insufficient societal interest and engagement in this crucial topic. To address this issue, TerraQ provides i**ndividuals with small, actionable missions tailored to combat climate challenges**. By offering **rewards** based on mission accomplishment, we leverage behavioral economics principles to inspire people to take proactive steps and engage in eco-friendly practices autonomously, fostering a greener, more sustainable future.

**12.2 - Sustainable Management and Efficient Use of Natural Resources**

TerraQ encourages individuals and businesses to engage in sustainable consumption and production. By offering actionable missions, our platform supports efficient use of resources, ensuring their conservation for future generations.

TerraQ offers missions like beach cleanups that aim to reduce marine pollution, including plastic waste and other debris that negatively impact our oceans, toward the preservation of marine ecosystems and the overall health of our planet.
#
## **4. Implementation**
### Architecture

Our team chose a robust and scalable architecture for the TerraQ solution, consisting of the following high-level components and their responsibilities:

- **Backend**: Developed using **Spring Boot**, Java, and **Google Cloud Platform**, the backend handles user authentication, data storage, and communication between individuals and the platform.
- **Frontend**: Built with **Flutter and Dart**, the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for individuals and businesses to access sustainable missions, track progress, and manage rewards.
- **Technologies**: The platform utilizes a combination of technologies, such as cloud-based infrastructure for scalability for mission personalization and waste categorization.
- **Programming Languages**: Java for backend development and Dart for frontend development.
- Tools: Spring Boot (backend framework), Flutter (frontend framework), and Google Cloud Platform (database, cloud engine, storage service and authentication).
